### Commits since final release

The main branch of this repository differs from the source code of the final release only in as much as this `README.md` was added for display by GitHub.

## Note about compiling the component help file.

`Help/PJMenuSpeedButtons.rtf` contains the original source of the help file. This `.rtf`, together with `Help/PJMenuSpeedButtons.hpj` are required ti compile to the final WinHelp file using the Microsoft Help Compiler, _HCRTF_.

A copy of the compiled help file is included in `menusb-1.1.0-FINAL.zip`, available from the [final release](https://github.com/ddab-archive/menusb/releases/tag/v1.1.0-FINAL) page.
